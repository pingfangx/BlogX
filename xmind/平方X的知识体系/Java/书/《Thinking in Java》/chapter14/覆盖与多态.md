> This is a typical class hierarchy diagram, with the base class at the top and the derived classes growing downward. The normal goal in object-oriented programming is for your code to manipulate references to the base type (Shape, in this case), so if you decide to extend the program by adding a new class (such as Rhomboid, derived from Shape), the bulk of the code is not affected. In this example, the dynamically bound method in the Shape interface is draw( ), so the intent is for the client programmer to call draw( ) through a generic Shape reference. In all of the derived classes, draw( ) is overridden, and because it is a dynamically bound method, the proper behavior will occur even though it is called through a generic Shape reference. Thatâ€™s polymorphism.
