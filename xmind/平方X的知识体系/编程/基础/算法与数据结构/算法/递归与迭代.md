[Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)

> Recursion (adjective: recursive) occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.

[Iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration)

> Iteration is the repetition of a process in order to generate a (possibly unbounded) sequence of outcomes. The sequence will approach some end point or end value. Each repetition of the process is a single iteration, and the outcome of each iteration is then the starting point of the next iteration. In mathematics and computer science, iteration (along with the related technique of recursion) is a standard element of algorithms.

将递归理解为一个方法调用自身。

将迭代理解为一个循环，循环有结束条件，在循环中每一次的计算结果用于下一次计算
