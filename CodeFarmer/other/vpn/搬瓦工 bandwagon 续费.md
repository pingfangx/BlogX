    How does renewal work; will you charge me automatically?
    Automatic payments
    First and foremost: we never charge your Credit Card or Paypal account automatically. We do not store customer's payment information, therefore we are technically unable to auto-charge you. All payments to Bandwagonhost are user-initiated, without exception.

    Renewal status explanation
    Unless you cancel the renewal, our system will automatically send a new invoice on the renewal date. If you have funds in the account, they will be used automatically to pay the invoice.

    If your account does not have enough credit balance to cover the invoice, we will notify you and you will have 7 days to pay the due invoice. After 7 days of non-payment the service will be suspended.

    To verify whether or not renewal is active please use this link: https://bandwagonhost.com/clientarea.php?action=products

    If Renewal is set to ON, it means that a new invoice for the next period will be issued on renewal date.

    If Renewal is set to OFF, it means that the VPS will be terminated (cancelled) automatically on renewal date and no invoices/warnings will be sent out.

    How to restore service renewal
    If you had previously cancelled the renewal and would like us to reactivate it, please follow these steps:
    1. In most cases Renewal can be enabled by the customer by following this link: https://bandwagonhost.com/clientarea.php?action=products (click Restore link)
    2. If Restore link is not available please create a ticket


    Can I renew service ahead of time?
    We are unable to offer renewals ahead of time. If you plan to leave for a long period of time and would like services to be renewed without having to make manual payments, you can simply add funds to your account. The funds will be used automatically to pay any future invoices. If you'd like to add funds to your account please click here.

    Can I change my billing term (renewal cycle)?

根据文档，不可以提前续期，只可以向帐户中充值。  
到期时会自动生成帐单，如果帐户中有余额，就会自动支付。  
于是提前充值一下就可以了。
