> btw: the actual word "ellipsized" is made-up. It's called "verbing a noun" and is a common way to form computer jargon. The noun is "ellipse" which I assume you know, and it's made into a verb by adding the "-ize" ending which means "to make into", so you can infer that to "ellipsize" is "to add an ellipse to something".

>If set, causes words that are longer than the view is wide to be **ellipsized** instead of broken in the middle.
